EdTech
Welcome to the EdTech platform.

Overview
On the EdTech platform, users can sign up or log in, and their data is securely stored in the Google Firebase database. The landing page showcases product images and details, allowing users to purchase products using two payment gateways: PayPal and Stripe.

Technology Used
Frontend: React with Vite for better runtime performance.
Styling: Tailwind CSS framework.
Backend: Google Firebase for user authentication.

Note: I could not integrate the payment gateways with Firebase due to Google's requirement for a paid account.

Active Routes
"/" - The landing/home page
"/login" - The login page
"/signup" - The signup page
"/success" - The page users are redirected to upon successful payment
"/cancel" - The page users are redirected to if there is an error with payment

I couldn't proceed with switching to a live business account because the platform requires an upgrade to a professional plan, which involves an additional cost.

and I am requesting you to
view my assignment with your screen size set to 90% for the best experience. 


Thank you for considering my project.
